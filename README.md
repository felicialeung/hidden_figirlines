# Hidden Figirlines

Discover HerStory—One Figirline at a Time

## What it does
Users can play a timeline game where they simultaneously sort and learn about historical achievements and celebrations of women, in chronological order. After sorting them correctly, they earn coins, which can be used to pull female figurines from blind boxes in a series of their choice (Sports, STEM, Politics). Users can then admire their figurines in their bookshelf, which displays the figure and their photocard, containing information about a different woman’s historical impact and story.
